# Holiday Code Challenge

The challenge is simple: Create a snowfall in front of a background image.

The folder contains all the basic assets you'll need to create a holiday snowfall.
You may use any libraries or tools you wish. You may change out the assets for
your own. Feel free to make the challenge your own!

Bonus points for the following:

- Use/mimic parallax so that snow falling closer to you appears to fall faster
- Use a bit of randomness/noise to make snowflakes in any given plane fall at slightly different rates
- Use a bit of randomness/noise to make snowflakes gently move left to right as they fall so it looks like they are getting blown about in the wind
- Make snowflakes that are closer appear larger and softer
- When a snowflake hits the ground, colour a pixel white to give the effect of build up of snow
